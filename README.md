    My IP Tools

## Deployed at [myip.tools](https://www.myip.tools) ... because I got tired of going to IP address information + port checking sites.

SPA built with React deployed embedded inside a Go binary that acts as the server for checking the IP address of the client and if the port in question is open.

Also was used as a catalyst for learning [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest).
